# Gas-Station-Simulation using anylogic software

Our project is a simulation of a gas station,
As we are facing several problems recently, which is the presence of large transport vehicles with petrol or solar powered cars, while there are small owners cars parked in crowds that cannot go to their places to supply them with gasoline.
Therefore, we will create simulations for entry and exit places and places for large cars and small cars, so that we have in our project 4 tanks to be enough to not be crowded so that I maintain order and people do not wait for a long time.
